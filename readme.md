## Creating a Pull Request
1. Create a GitHub account, if you haven't already, and connect it with [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
2. Star and fork this repository in the upper right hand corner.
3. Once forking is done loading, click on the green `clone or download` button and copy the link.
4. Open Git in your desired location for the folder by right clicking and clicking on `Git Bash Here`. Make sure you know where you're saving your folder.
5. Type `git clone (link)` and paste your link (shift + insert on Windows or insert on Mac). Do not include the parenthesis.
6. Type `exit` to close out of Git.
7. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code by either dragging the folder onto the icon or opening the folder from Visual Studio Code's menu.
8. Add your name and your GitHub handle to the winners section in the format that I have. Suggestions are welcome.
9. Once you are done with your changes, save your work and close Visual Studio Code. Open Git again.
10. You can check the status of your branch by typing `git status`. This will tell you what files were modified, added, or deleted.
11. Type `git add .` to stage all files that were modified. You can select individual files by typing `git add (file names)`, but for now, use the former command. Do not include the parenthesis.
12. Type `git commit -m "message"`. In your message, you want to include a description of what you modified.
13. Type `git push origin master`.
14. Now, go back to GitHub. If you go to your repository, you should see an alert to create a pull request. Click it.
15. You can add a comment if you'd like. Submit it.
16. Receive a cool shirt after doing four of these!
17. Happy coding! If you have any questions, comment on the issue and I will try to get back to you. Also, try Googling your question and see if you can't find the answer on your own. :)
